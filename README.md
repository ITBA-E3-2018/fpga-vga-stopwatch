# fpga-vga-stopwatch: An Altera Cyclone IV VGA stopwatch

The idea of this FPGA software designed for the Altera Cyclone IV board was to experiment with FPGA design. 

Written entirely in Verilog, the project features VGA compatibility. Its purpose is to show a stopwatch on any VGA display in up to 65536 different colors. The stopwatch can be stopped and reset at any point using the development board's on-board push buttons.
